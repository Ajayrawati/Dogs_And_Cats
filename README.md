This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. Built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model achieves high accuracy by learning key features of both animals through extensive training on a labeled dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation steps, along with visualization of performance metrics. It's a simple yet effective demonstration of image classification using deep learning.
